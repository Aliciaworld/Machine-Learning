### What is a GAM?
A GAM is a linear model. But it is allowed to learn non-linear features.

GAMs relax the restriction that the relationship must be a simple weighted sum, and instead assume that the outcome can be modelled by a sum of arbitrary functions of each feature.To do this, we simply replace beta coefficients from linear regression with a flexible function which allows nonlinear relationships, which is called "spline".

Therefore, splines are complex functions that allow us to model non-linear relationships for each feature.
