One of the most important ways to improve the quality of a dataset is data augmentation.

When I'm planning out my activities on getting more data through data augmentation or through actual data collection?

Data augmentation can be a very efficient way to get more data, especially for unstructured data problems, such as images, audio, maybe text.

The goal of data augmentation is to create examples that learning algorithm can learn from.
